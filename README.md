Hello there this is my very first tool in github.
Previously wrote some scripts for automating my tasks. But this time i'd like to make some useful scripts for ya'll lazy people.
This script shows your current networks ip and your public ip.

Instructions:-


1)First you need to execute the make file like this 'bash make' and hit enter
2)After that a command will be alloucated
and the command is 'ninja' which wil execute my script everytime you need to hit the word ninja for executing this script.

thats it.
