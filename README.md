Hello there this is my very first tool in github.
Previously wrote some scripts for automating my tasks. But this time i'd like to make some useful scripts for ya'll lazy people.
This script shows your current networks ip and your public ip.

Instructions:-


1)First you need to execute the make file (like this ./make and hit enter)
2)After this a command will be alloucated
The command for this script is 'ninja'
Everytime you need to hit the word ninja for executing this script.
